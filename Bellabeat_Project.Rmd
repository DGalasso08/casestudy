# *Google Capstone Project*

## *Overview of Project*

Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. As a junior data analyst on the marketing strategy team at Bellabeat, I've been tasked with reviewing smart-device data from another company to analyze trends in smart-device usage in order to inform Bellabeat marketing to elevate the company beyond a small player in the global smart device industry. My analysis will focus on how data subjects use their devices to gain insights for Bellabeat's marketing team. To accomplish this, I will follow the steps of data analysis: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

## Prepare

### Data Description
#### From Kaggle
*"This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences."*

#### Data Format
This dataset is a collection of multiple long-format tables. Each table has a collection of various data points about specific health metrics of the subjects, measured by day and minute.

#### Key Points after Quick Data Review
* The data tracks __33__ not 30 Fitbit users.
* The data spans from 4-12-16 to 5-12-16, not 3-12-16 to 5-12-16.
* Some tables have repeat information.

### Data Credibility
#### *Does this data ROCCC?*
1. **R**eliable: This dataset is too small a sample to eliminate the possibility of sample bias. It also lacks any demographic information (such as age and gender) or geographic information to help determine how reliable it is. It is therefore not reliable.
2. **O**riginal: This data was collected via a survey created and distributed by Amazon Mechanical Turk to Fitbit users, not any surveys or data collected by Bellabeat regarding their own user data. It is therefore not original.
3. **C**omprehensive: This dataset claims to include 30 users over the course of 2 months; however, the actual data includes 33 users over the course of only one month, or 31 days. The human error in the description coupled with the even smaller range of dates observed makes this data not comprehensive.
4. **C**urrent: The dataset is from April and May of 2016, which is not particularly current in 2022, especially with a growing variety of smart devices on the market today.
5. **C**ited: This dataset is cited in the description, and has a CC0:Public Domain license. It is cited.

#### Takeaways on Data Credibility
* Given that this data is an incredibly small sample, taken over a short period of time, from a outside source, with multiple errors in the data description and without demographic or geographic information about the data subjects, I would not use it exclusively to analyze and make recommendations to Bellabeat. 
* I can use this data for a small number of general trends to assess, such as daily use, to start informing the marketing strategy team, but I would want to include other datasets, and highly encourage the team to collect internal data from Bellabeat's own customers and products to make higher level, more specific analyses and gain stronger insights.
* The analysis I perform is only going to include a small subset of this data, and it will be a very general, basic analysis of daily use. Because of the lack of credibility of the data, I don't feel comfortable performing an in-depth analysis using this dataset. Using this data exclusively for an in-depth analysis could misinform the team and ultimately lead Bellabeat to make harmful decisions.

## Process
### **Cleaning the Data**

#### The Tools
I will be using Google Sheets and Big Query to clean the data. I've chosen to clean primarily in Google Sheets because I'm only using a small subset of the data in the dataset due to its compromised credibility. If I were to have a more reliable dataset that was larger, I would primarily clean using a SQL client or R because these tools are much better equipped when dealing with large data. My version of Big Query does not allow me to create temp tables, which is another reason I've chosen to primarily use Google Sheets.

#### Let's Get Started!
**1. Clean up names of Column headers for readability**; include any measurement references in column names:

  a)	Changed column names to include spaces, such as “ActivityDate” to           “Activity Date” in Daily_Activity sheet
  
  b)	Added (km) in parenthesis to any distance-related columns to clarify        unit of measurement – I am assuming here that the values in these          columns are in km, not miles; this assumption is based on the              values themselves – first entry in Daily_Activity sheet as a value         of 13,162 for steps, and a value of 8.5 for total distance. 13000          steps would not equal 8.5 miles. 
  
  
**2.	Check data types for each column** to ensure consistency with column values, to make values more meaningful/readable and to allow seamless uploading to other platforms:

  a)	Looking at the data, it seems like Daily_Intensities, Daily_Steps,         and Daily_Calories Sheets might be redundant – this information            appears to be included in the Daily_Activity sheet. If the                 information is redundant, we can delete these extraneous sheets. 
      To check this, I made a new sheet called “Comparing Columns” and           created a column for all of the shared column names across the sheets       (with exception to Id and Date): this included Calories, as well as        each activity level classification (Very Sedentary, Fairly Active,         etc.) for both minutes and distance. I then used an if function as          follows: 
          **=IF (Daily_Activity!G:G = Daily_Intensities!J:J, true, false)**

*(This function allows me to compare 2 columns across 2 sheets, to see if they are equal to one another. If that condition is met, the result is TRUE,  and if not met, FALSE. I ran this function for each of the duplicate columns across the sheets, to determine that the Daily_Intensities, Daily_Steps and Daily_Calories sheets did not contain any information that doesn’t already exist in the Daily_Activity sheet, so I can go ahead and delete those sheets to remove clutter.)* 
  
  ![Comparing tables using the IF function.](/cloud/project/Photo_Comparing_Columns.png)

  b)	Activity Date column in Daily_Activity Sheet: I changed the data type       to “Date” by selecting the entire column and choosing the                  formatting icon to ensure all entries are formatted by date data           type. This will allow me to easily upload this dataset across              different platforms, such as Big Query and R.
  
  c)	Using same steps as above, I changed the data type for the following       columns to Number: Total Steps, Total Distance (km), Tracker Distance       (km), Logged Activities Distance (km), Very Active Distance (km),          Moderately Active Distance (km), Light Active Distance (km),               Sedentary Active Distance (km).  
  
  d)	I want to also wants to ensure that the time frame listed in the           description of dataset is accurate, as well as the number of data          subjects. According to the Kaggle description, this data was               collected from 3-12-2016 to 5-12-2016 from 30 data subjects. I can         verify this in Big Query with a few simply queries.
  
  To start, I created a new dataset in my current project, which I named     “Bellabeats.” Then, I created a new table named “daily_activity” and       uploaded the corresponding csv, which I created in Google Sheets and       saved to my local computer. Then, I wrote a simple query to count the      distinct number of ids, to determine how many users are represented in     this data:
  
  SELECT  
  COUNT(DISTINCT(Id))
  FROM 
  `valiant-epsilon-344212.Bellabeats.daily_activity`
  
  *This query returned a result of 33, meaning that there are actually 33     fitbit device users represented in this data, not 30 as originally         stated.* To be sure those extra 3 ids are not just the result of typos,    I can run another query to inspect each individual Id, making sure none    of the values look like typos, using the SELECT DISTINCT statement.

  SELECT DISTINCT 
  Id
  FROM 
  `valiant-epsilon-344212.Bellabeats.daily_activity`
  
  *This query returns all distinct or unique values in the Id column. After    inspecting these values, it appears that there are 33 different unique     Ids, or 33 users being examined in the dataset, not 30 as the              description stated.*

  I can also use the above steps to check the date range for the data. The   date range listed in the description was 3-12-2016 through 5-12-2016.      Running the same queries as above but for the “Activity Date” columns, I   determine that the date range is actually 4-12-2016 through 5-12-2016, or   31 days. This is a different range than what’s listed in the description. 
  *(These items could also be completed in Google Sheets, by creating pivot   tables with summaries by countunique.)*
  
  
**3. Check Daily_Activity sheet for null values and asses them**
To check for null values, I used conditional formatting to highlight any empty cells. No cells are highlighted, so no cells are empty, which means our data is complete and not missing any values.
The sheet does have many 0s as entries. Conditional formatting will highlight these by setting the condition =0. With this condition, I see there are instances of the entire row being highlighted, or every column having a value of 0; I can assume the user did not wear their device on that day. I can dive deeper into these instances once data is cleaned for the analysis. 


**4. Check data types and column names of the Daily_Sleep sheet.** 
  a)	Place spaces appropriately in column names.
  
  b)	In the Daily_Sleep sheet, I notice that the Sleep Day column contains     both the date, as well as a time stamp. However, upon examining the        values in the column, it appears that every entry contains the same        time – 0:00:00, or midnight. There are 3 other columns: Total Sleep        Records, Total Time Asleep (minutes) and Total Time in Bed (minutes) –     I changed the last 2 columns to include minutes in parenthesis to make     those column names more consistent and readable. Without additional        information, I can’t be certain if these time columns are measuring the     minutes passed since midnight, or just minutes passed since the subject     went to bed; the data would be more complete here if it included a time     stamp of when the subject went to bed. Without this information, I am      going to assume that these time columns are recording the number of        minutes since midnight that the subject was in bed and sleeping.           Because each entry in the Sleep Day column is assessed beginning at        midnight, I am going to alter the column name to “Sleep Day (beginning     at 0:00:00)” and then change the data type in the column to the date       data type. This makes the column more readable and removes extraneous      information in each cell. 
  
  c) I once again want to check the number of unique entries in the Id         column, this time in the Daily_Sleep sheet. When I create a pivot table     with the Id column as the value being summarized by the unique count, I     see a value of 24, meaning that there are only 24 data subjects being      tracked in this sheet, not 33 as in the other 2 sheets. I will make the     assumption that the users whose ids are not included in the Daily_Sleep     data did not wear their device to bed to track their sleep, which could     be useful information for my stakeholders. However, given the limited      scope of this analysis due to the compromised dataset, I will omit the     Daily_Sleep data from my analysis.

**5. Now, my data is nearly clean!** I want to check the Daily_Activity sheet for any missing dates and fill those in with 0s. I’m going to do this because in my analysis, I want to look at how often each user wore their smart device, and it will be easier to look at that if all dates are present for each user, with 0s in the metrics columns for any missing dates, or dates which the user did not wear their device. Some of the user ids have all dates present, with 0s in the metrics columns, and I want my sheet to be consistent throughout. 

**6. Another important step in cleaning the data is to check for duplicates.** While this is possible in Big Query and in R Studio, I’m going to remove duplicates in Google Sheets because that’s where the majority of my cleaning has taken place! It’s as simple as going to the Data drop down menu, choosing Data Cleanup > Remove Duplicates. The Daily_Activity sheet had 0 duplicate entries.

**7. Now, my data is clean!** I download the clean data from Google Sheets as .csv file and save to my local computer, so that I can upload this cleaned dataset to R Studio. I saved it as a separate file from the original dataset provided.


## Analyze and Share
### *In R Studio*


**1. Install tidyverse package.**

```{r}
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

**2. Load libraries.**

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```
These are the libraries I'll use in the tidyverse package for analysis. The readr package will allow me to use my .csv files, the dplyr package allows me to manipulate my data, and ggplot2 of course allows me to create visualizations. 

**3. Upload and read .csv files**

Using the file pane in the bottom right, upload the Daily Activity .csv file from local computer. Now, I can read and analyze the file in RStudio.

```{r}
daily_activity <- read_csv("Cleaned_Fitbit_Daily_Activity.csv")
```

**4. Take a look at the new dataframe.**

* view the dataframe
```{r}
head(daily_activity)
```

* inspect column names
```{r}
colnames(daily_activity)
```

* inspect structure
```{r}
str(daily_activity)
```

* view summary of data frame
```{r}
summary(daily_activity)
```

**5. Let's look at some summary statistics of activity data.**

This is to get a *very* general sense of the activity level of the data subjects.

* average total steps by user
```{r}
daily_activity %>%
  group_by(Id) %>%
  summarise(avg_steps = mean(`Total Steps`))
```

* min and max total steps per user by date
```{r}
daily_activity %>%
  group_by(Id) %>%
  summarise(least_steps = min(`Total Steps`), most_steps = max(`Total Steps`))
```

*This tibble illustrates that there were many users who did not wear their device for at least one day, rendering a 0 for the least_steps column.* A Fitbit tracks the user's steps throughout the day while the user is wearing the device; if a user registers a value of 0 for Total Steps, this means the user didn't wear their Fitbit on that particular day. I can use this information later to see how frequently users wore their devices, as well as examining step data to get a sense of the activity level of each user.

* summary stats on active minutes columns
```{r}
daily_activity %>%
  select(`Very Active Minutes`,
         `Fairly Active Minutes`,
         `Lightly Active Minutes`,
         `Sedentary Minutes`) %>%
  summary()
```
This gives me the summary stats for each Active Minute column. From this information, I can see that the categories with the greatest averages, meaning the most time spent, are the less active categories - the *Lightly Active Minutes* column has a mean value of 177.2 minutes, and the *Sedentary Minutes* column has a mean value of 910.8 minutes. These are significantly greater than the means of the *Very Active Minutes* column, which has a mean of 19.45 minutes, and the *Fairly Active Minutes* column, which has a mean of 12.46 minutes. This tells me that on average, the data subjects are not spending at least 30 minutes per day exercising, which is the recommended daily exercise according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916#:~:text=As%20a%20general%20goal%2C%20aim,your%20risk%20of%20metabolic%20problems.) and the [American Heart Association.](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults) **The big picture takeaway here? The data subjects in this study are not avid exercisers.**

* to further illustrate the above point, let's look at average Very Active Minutes by user

```{r}
avg_active_minutes <- daily_activity %>%
  group_by(Id) %>%
  summarise(avg_active = mean(`Very Active Minutes`))
head(avg_active_minutes)
```
All but 7 users had less than 30 minutes daily of Very Active Minutes. 

*It is important to note here that the data description did not provide any information regarding the classification of minutes. This means I do not know what criteria need to be met for minutes to be classified as "Very Active," etc. I'm working on the assumption that only "Very Active Minutes" can be classified as full aerobic exercises.*

* now I'll take a look at average sedentary minutes to confirm what I discovered above.

```{r}
avg_sedentary_minutes <- daily_activity %>%
  group_by(Id) %>%
  summarise(avg_sedentary = mean(`Sedentary Minutes`))
head(avg_sedentary_minutes)
```
As is evident in the table above, the average number of daily sedentary minutes per subject is significantly greater than the Very Active Minutes, meaning the subjects in this data are much less active than they are sedentary.


**6. Now, I can further manipulate steps data to uncover more information.**

* I'm now going to categorize users based on their activity levels. *It is important to note here that due to the limitations in the data, I am making an assumption that the Very Active Minutes is the only category that can be considered exercise.* Without specific information regarding the classification of minutes in each category, the only option (if using this dataset alone) is to make an assumption about the categorizing of minutes.

```{r}
user_categories <- avg_active_minutes %>%
  mutate(user_type = case_when(
    avg_active > 30 ~ 'Active User',
    avg_active >= 15 & avg_active <=30 ~ 'Moderate Active User',
    avg_active < 15 ~ 'Non Active User'
    ))
head(user_categories)  
```
I've categorized users based on their average Very Active Minutes. If the user has more than an overage of 30 minutes of Very Active time, they are classified as an "Active User," 15-30 minutes, a "Moderate Active User," and less than 15 minutes, a "Non Active User." 

* Now, let's plot that distribution of user categories on a chart to really see how many of each user type there is. I'll use a bar chart to show count of y-axis of each user type on the x-axis. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = user_categories) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = user_type, fill = user_type)) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = "Count of Each User Type Based on Activity Level",
       caption = "Data collected by Amazon Mechanical Turk")
```

*As is evident from the chart, more than half of the subjects observed in this data are not active users at all.* In fact, only 7 are considered very active, or with an average of more than 30 very active minutes per day. 

* Now, I'll look at step data again to see how frequently users did not wear their devices.
```{r}
inactive_days <- daily_activity %>%
  group_by(Id) %>%
  filter(`Total Steps` == 0) %>%
  summarise(no_steps = n_distinct(`Activity Date`))
head(inactive_days)
```
This gives an idea how many days, in the 31 day study period, users did not track their steps, meaning they didn't wear their devices.

```{r}
summary(inactive_days)
```

By running the summary stats and focusing on the no_steps column information, I can see that the maximum value is 28, meaning that at least 1 user did not wear their device for 28 of the 31 days in the study. The average number of days that the users registered 0 steps, or did not wear their devices, was roughly 8 days out of 31 days.


* Now I want to see how many users registered steps every one of the 31 days in the observation period, meaning they wore their device every day.

```{r}
active_days <- daily_activity %>%
  group_by(Id) %>%
  filter(`Total Steps` != 0) %>%
  summarise(active_days = (n_distinct(`Activity Date`)))
head(active_days)
```
By viewing the entire data frame, I can see that 14 of 33 users registered 1 or more steps on each of the 31 days in the observation period. This means that 14 users, or 42% of users in this data, wore their devices every single day. 

Now, I'm going to create user categories based on frequency of device wearing. I'll use the inactive_days data frame, and mutate it into a new data frame that includes a column for user type. These user types are simply based on how many "no step days" or *non-wearing days* each user had in the observation period. **It is important to note that this does not include the 14 users who had daily wear; this is only examining those users who did not have daily wear.**

```{r}
step_users <- inactive_days %>%
  mutate(user_frequency = case_when(
    no_steps <= 1 ~ 'Near Daily User',
    no_steps <= 5 & no_steps > 1 ~ 'Frequent User',
    no_steps <= 10 & no_steps > 5 ~ 'Moderate User',
    no_steps <= 15 & no_steps > 10 ~ 'Casual User',
    no_steps <= 20 & no_steps > 15 ~ 'Infrequent User',
    no_steps > 20 ~ 'Very Infrequent User'
    
  )) 
head(step_users)
```

Let's take a look at the distribution of each user type by running a count distinct function in a new dataframe and view it.

```{r}
categories_of_steps <- step_users %>%
  group_by(user_frequency) %>%
  summarise(count = n_distinct(Id))

head(categories_of_steps)
```

From this data frame, I can clearly see that almost an equal number of users were daily users with only one day of no wear, and casual users, with between 10 and 15 days of no wear. These categories are still less than the daily wear users, who did not have any no step days. *This is important information I'll use to develop my final insights.*

For now, I'll plot the no step data on a bar chart, using the user types on the x-axis, with the y-axis showing the count or number of each of those users.

```{r}
ggplot(data = step_users) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = user_frequency, fill = user_frequency)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = "Fitbit Users by Frequency of Use",
       subtitle = "Of 19 Non Daily Users",
       caption = "Data collected by Amazon Mechanical Turk ")
```

This chart visualizes the distribution of each of the user types, where I can again clearly see and show that most of the data subjects with at least one no step day fall into 2 somewhat opposite categories.

**7. Play around in Tableau!**
I've also created a [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/danielle5803/viz/BellabeatCaseStudy_16590486644100/ComparingActiveandSedentaryMinutesperUser) that compares the Very Active Minutes and Sedentary Minutes Over Time, filtered on the user with step data included. This allows my stakeholders to get to know the users a little better, view activity trends over time, and compare users to themselves as well as to other users. For example, this graphic could show if users became more or less active as the study progressed over the month. *This was mainly just fun.*

**8. I have the basic analysis prepared, it's time to move on to the conclusions and insights.**

### Key Takeaways 


1. **Most users do not average 30+ minutes of exercise per day, meaning they aren't very active.** 26 of the 33 users, or nearly 79%, averaged less than 30 Very Active Minutes per day. Bellabeat can use this information in multiple ways:
    * Target Audience: Most users of Fitbit devices were not extremely           active, meaning that Bellabeat should cater its advertising to less        active users for maximum impact. I would recommend creating and            distributing a survey to these customers, having respondents answer        questions regarding which device they wear and why, and what their         health goals are. This will inform Bellabeat if users are wearing          devices to become more active or track specific metrics of their           health, leading to developments in those particular products and           features. Examples of these features could be as simple as step            notifications throughout the day, or stickers for exceeding a certain       number of Very Active Minutes to encourage users to be more active. 
    * Product Development: It's worth exploring Bellabeat's device features       for opportunities to improve design and wearability for intense            exercise. For example, very active smart-device users could prefer a       device with a more resilient band, waterproof or sweat-resistant           features, etc., while they are working out. I would strongly               encourage more research of Bellabeat's more active customers to            determine if design features could be optimized to increase the            number of active customers.
    
2. **42% of users are Daily Users.** The largest user category is those who wore their devices daily (who registered 0 step days), with 14 of the 33 users falling into this category. 21% of users were Casual Users, meaning that they had between 10 and 15 days of not wearing their devices. 18% of users were Near Daily Users, meaning they only had 1 day in which they did not wear their devices. 60% of the data subjects in this study logged steps on 30-31 days of the 31 day observation period. Bellabeat can use this information in a variety of ways: 
    * Bellabeat's marketing team can highlight the design features of the        products that make the devices optimum for day to day wear. They can       target their ads to those individuals who wear a smart device or want       to wear a smart device daily.
    * Bellabeat should consider design enhancements given the information        regarding daily wear. These could include bands with increased             durability or replacement band "programs" where users with a specific       number of "wearing days" can upgrade a watch band at a discounted          rate.
    * Bellabeat could also use these items above to transform more Casual        users to Daily or Near Daily users. *By adding incentives like a            replacement band program based on daily usage, for example.*

3. **Users generally wear their devices near daily, but don't exercise as frequently.**
    * This information could prove incredibly useful for Bellabeat. If           users aren't extremely active, but wear their devices near daily,          it's worth exploring why that might be -- do they want to increase         their activity levels or exercise more, are they tracking another          health-related metric, is it just a trendy device? These are all           questions that could lead to more informed advertising if the              Bellabeat customer shares the same trends. For example, if the users       are wearing the device in hopes of becoming more active, Bellabeat         and implement guided exercise/activity goal-setting on the app and         features on the device like the Leaf to alert the user where they          stand in terms of this goal. The advertising can also reflect this,        by marketing towards a less-active but goal-oriented individual. 

4. **More research!** There are a few specific areas I would recommend that Bellabeat focus more research within in order to gain a more complete picture of smart device trends:
    * First Party Data! Create and distribute surveys among Bellabeat            customers to determine *their* activity levels, wear habits, sleep         patterns, and health goals. Measure the participants for at least 6        months, to establish a larger sample size of data and ensure we have       more comprehensive and reliable data. This first-party data about          Bellabeat's own customers is going to provide much more insightful         information than third-party data. 
    * Consider customer surveys about the features of each product to            improve them. Email users of each device a survey with their feedback       on their specific device, and use their responses to brainstorm            updates or new technology to improve existing customer satisfaction        and increase future customers.
    * View and analyze data for other big names in smart device technology,       such as Apple Watch. Apple Watches have unique features like               "Activity Rings" which create incentives for the wearer to accomplish       activity-based tasks. Analyzing the effectiveness of such programs         could inform the product development team of potential updates to          existing products or ideas for new products.
